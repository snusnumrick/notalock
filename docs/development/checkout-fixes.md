# Checkout Flow Fixes

This document outlines the aggressive fixes implemented to resolve the infinite redirect loop in the checkout process.

## Problem

When a user clicked "Proceed to Checkout" from the cart page, the application entered an infinite redirect loop between different checkout steps, specifically between the information and shipping steps.

### Root Causes

1. **Multiple Cart IDs**: The system was using inconsistent cart IDs across different parts of the checkout flow:
   - Cookie cart ID: `2bc242e3-8bb7-49bf-afd0-ef961c714ddf`
   - Server cart ID: `e6c1d1d0-b4f6-4b4e-a6f8-851e774f6e52`
   - Active cart: `670e1161-ad94-4589-956e-732d676cc007`
   - "Cart with items": `bf52c68a-274a-46d8-b615-b12e3b4f9687`

2. **Redirect Logic Conflict**: The checkout info loader was deciding to redirect to the shipping step, but the main checkout loader was redirecting back to the information step.

3. **Path Detection Issues**: The checkout loaders weren't properly detecting the current URL path to prevent unnecessary redirects.

## Aggressive Fixes Implemented

1. **Force Information Step**: 
   - Added code that explicitly forces the checkout session's `currentStep` to "information" when on the information page
   - This directly blocks the attempt to redirect to shipping, breaking the loop
   - Also updates the database record to ensure consistency

2. **Block Unnecessary Redirects**:
   - Completely rewrote the main checkout loader to block redirects on specific pages
   - Now it only redirects when we're on the base `/checkout` path, otherwise it returns null
   - This prevents the checkout loader from interfering with step-specific routes

3. **Prioritize Session Cart ID**:
   - Completely reworked cart lookup to always prioritize the session's cart ID
   - Added explicit session-cart-first lookup in validateCartForCheckout
   - Added cart ID consistency check in the information loader
   - Only falls back to standard cart lookup if session cart is empty

## Affected Files

1. `/app/features/checkout/api/loaders.ts` 
   - Added direct session step override for information page
   - Added aggressive cart ID consistency fixes
   - Added additional logging for debugging

2. `/app/routes/_layout.checkout.tsx`
   - Rewrote the loader to block unnecessary redirects
   - Added path-based decision making to prevent loops

## Testing

To verify these fixes:
1. Clear browser cookies
2. Add items to cart
3. Click "Proceed to Checkout"
4. Verify that the checkout information page loads correctly without infinite loops
5. Complete the information form and proceed to shipping
6. Verify that shipping page loads correctly without redirecting back to information

## Notes

These fixes are intentionally aggressive to break the redirect loop. Once the system is stable, we should consider a more elegant refactoring of the checkout flow to avoid needing these protective measures.
