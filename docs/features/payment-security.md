# Payment Security and PCI Compliance

This document outlines the security measures and PCI compliance considerations for the payment processing system in the Notalock application.

## PCI DSS Compliance Overview

The Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) is a set of security standards designed to ensure that companies accepting, processing, storing, or transmitting credit card information maintain a secure environment.

### Our Approach to PCI Compliance

Notalock follows a **Service Provider** approach to PCI compliance by using trusted third-party payment processors (Square and Stripe) that handle card data collection and processing. This approach significantly reduces our PCI compliance scope.

## Key Security Features

### 1. No Card Data Storage

- Notalock **never** stores sensitive cardholder data on our servers
- All card details are collected directly by our payment providers' secure elements
- Card tokenization is used to reference payment methods without storing actual card details

### 2. Secure Integration Architecture

- Client-side:
  - Payment form components are isolated and use the payment providers' secure elements
  - Card data is tokenized and encrypted before transmission
  - No sensitive card data touches our application code

- Server-side:
  - Communication with payment APIs is done securely using TLS 1.2+
  - API keys are stored securely in environment variables, not in code
  - Webhook signatures are verified to prevent tampering

### 3. Strong Authentication and Authorization

- Payment administration features require strong authentication
- Administrative functions like refunds require specific permissions
- API access is limited by role and permission
- Webhook endpoints verify signatures to ensure authenticity

### 4. Security Headers and TLS

- HTTPS is required for all connections
- Strict Content Security Policy (CSP) headers are implemented
- HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security) is enabled
- TLS 1.2+ is enforced for all connections

### 5. Regular Security Auditing

- Dependency scanning for security vulnerabilities
- Regular security code reviews
- Monitoring of payment processor security bulletins
- Periodic penetration testing

## Technical Implementation Details

### Secure Form Implementation

1. **Isolated iframes**: Payment forms are rendered in isolated iframes by Square and Stripe
2. **Tokenization**: Card details are tokenized before being sent to our servers
3. **No card data logging**: Card details are never logged, even in error situations
4. **Secure integration**: We follow payment providers' security best practices

### Network Security

1. **TLS encryption**: All API communications use TLS 1.2+
2. **IP restrictions**: API access can be restricted by IP address
3. **Rate limiting**: API endpoints implement rate limiting to prevent abuse
4. **Webhook verification**: All webhooks are cryptographically verified

### Error Handling

1. **Sanitized errors**: Error messages never reveal sensitive information
2. **Detailed logging**: Comprehensive logging for troubleshooting without exposing sensitive data
3. **Graceful degradation**: System remains secure even during failures

## PCI DSS Requirements Overview

While our service provider approach reduces our compliance scope, we still maintain adherence to applicable PCI DSS requirements:

1. **Network Security**: Firewall protection for all systems
2. **Authentication**: Strong access controls and multi-factor authentication for administrative access
3. **Transmission Protection**: Encryption of all payment-related data in transit
4. **Vulnerability Management**: Regular security updates and vulnerability scans
5. **Access Control**: Least privilege principle for all system access
6. **Monitoring**: Security logging and alert systems
7. **Security Policy**: Comprehensive information security policy

## Customer Protection Measures

1. **Address Verification Service (AVS)**: Enabled for all transactions
2. **Card Verification Value (CVV)**: Required for all transactions
3. **3D Secure**: Support for 3D Secure authentication when required by card issuer
4. **Fraud monitoring**: Automated fraud detection with configurable rules
5. **Transparent receipts**: Clear, detailed receipts for all transactions

## Incident Response

In the event of a security incident:

1. **Immediate assessment**: Determine the scope and impact
2. **Containment**: Isolate affected systems
3. **Communication**: Notify affected parties as required by law
4. **Investigation**: Conduct thorough analysis
5. **Remediation**: Address vulnerabilities
6. **Documentation**: Record all steps taken
7. **Review**: Improve security controls based on findings

## Compliance Documentation

The following documentation is available for regulatory and audit purposes:

1. **Security policy**: Comprehensive information security policy
2. **Incident response plan**: Procedures for responding to security incidents
3. **Risk assessment**: Regular evaluation of security risks
4. **Penetration test reports**: Results of security testing
5. **Vulnerability scans**: Regular scans for security vulnerabilities
6. **Access control documentation**: Records of system access controls
7. **Training materials**: Security awareness training for staff

## Best Practices for Developers

When working with the payment integration:

1. **Never log card data**: Even for debugging purposes
2. **Use tokenization**: Always use payment tokens instead of raw card data
3. **Isolate payment code**: Keep payment processing logic separated
4. **Verify webhooks**: Always verify webhook signatures
5. **Secure API keys**: Store API keys securely in environment variables
6. **Monitor for vulnerabilities**: Keep dependencies updated
7. **Test securely**: Use test cards and sandbox environments
