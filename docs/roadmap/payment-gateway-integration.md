# Payment Gateway Integration Development Plan

## 1. Overview

This development plan outlines the tasks required to implement full integration with Square and Stripe payment gateways for the Notalock e-commerce platform. The plan is organized into phases with specific deliverables and dependencies.

## 2. Current Implementation Status

The project already has a provider-based architecture for payment processing with:

## 4. Implementation Details

### 4.1 Square Web Payments SDK Integration

```typescript
// Example of Square Web Payments SDK initialization
import { payments } from '@square/web-sdk';

export async function initializeSquare(applicationId: string, locationId: string) {
  try {
    const payments = await window.Square.payments(applicationId, locationId);
    
    const card = await payments.card();
    await card.attach('#card-container');
    
    return { payments, card };
  } catch (e) {
    console.error('Square initialization error:', e);
    throw e;
  }
}
```

### 4.2 Stripe Elements Integration

```typescript
// Example of Stripe Elements initialization
import { loadStripe } from '@stripe/stripe-js';
import { Elements, CardElement } from '@stripe/react-stripe-js';

// Initialize Stripe
const stripePromise = loadStripe(process.env.STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY);

// Stripe Elements component
export function StripeCardForm({ clientSecret }) {
  return (
    <Elements stripe={stripePromise} options={{ clientSecret }}>
      <CardElement options={{ style: { /* ... */ } }} />
      {/* Payment button and logic */}
    </Elements>
  );
}
```

### 4.3 Webhook Handler Implementation

```typescript
// Example of webhook handler for payment status updates
export async function handlePaymentWebhook(request) {
  const signature = request.headers.get('signature');
  const body = await request.text();
  
  try {
    // Verify webhook signature (Square or Stripe)
    // ...
    
    // Process webhook event
    const event = parseWebhookEvent(body, signature);
    
    if (event.type === 'payment.updated') {
      // Update order status based on payment status
      await updateOrderFromPayment(event.data);
    }
    
    return new Response('Webhook received', { status: 200 });
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Webhook error:', error);
    return new Response('Webhook error', { status: 400 });
  }
}
```

## 5. Security Considerations

### 5.1 PCI Compliance
- No card data should be stored on our servers
- Use only PCI-compliant SDKs for payment collection
- Implement proper access controls for payment functionality
- Follow security best practices for API key storage

### 5.2 Data Protection
- Encrypt sensitive customer data in transit and at rest
- Implement proper data retention policies
- Use tokenization for payment methods
- Regularly audit security practices

### 5.3 Fraud Prevention
- Implement basic fraud detection measures
- Monitor for suspicious payment patterns
- Add address verification (AVS) and CVV checks
- Consider implementing 3D Secure for high-risk transactions

## 6. Testing Strategy

### 6.1 Unit Tests
- Create unit tests for payment provider implementations
- Test error handling and edge cases
- Mock external API calls for testing

### 6.2 Integration Tests
- Test full payment flows end-to-end
- Verify webhook handling
- Test with sandbox/test environments

### 6.3 Manual Testing Scenarios
- Complete purchases with various payment methods
- Test different card types (credit, debit, international)
- Test declined payments and error scenarios
- Verify receipt generation and delivery

## 7. Rollout Plan

### 7.1 Staging Deployment
- Deploy to staging environment
- Conduct thorough testing with test accounts
- Verify all payment flows and webhooks

### 7.2 Production Deployment
- Start with a limited release (percentage of users)
- Monitor for issues and payment success rates
- Gradually increase availability to all users
- Keep mock payment provider as fallback option initially

### 7.3 Post-Deployment Monitoring
- Set up payment success/failure monitoring
- Create alerts for payment processing issues
- Monitor response times and error rates
- Regularly review payment logs for issues

## 8. Documentation

### 8.1 Technical Documentation
- Update code documentation for all payment-related code
- Document provider-specific implementations
- Create troubleshooting guides for common issues

### 8.2 User Documentation
